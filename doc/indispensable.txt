INTRODUCTION                                               *indispensable*

Based on vim-sensible. This simple plugin is the result of cleaning up my
init.vim

There is functionality like delete trailing spaces. Show trailing spaces in red
but for this later functionality vim-better-whitespace is required.

Fixes issues when using Vim in terminal to load all the colors possible.

Opens man pages in your favourite editor, I am talking about Vim/neovim.

Changes the highlights when a preview window is open.

If you use zsh (if you don't maybe you should give it a try) it will add it to
your runtimepath.

Makes neovim terminal behave more like vim's terminal. nonumber, start in
insert mode, closes on exiting terminal. fzf, ranger and coc are taking into
account.

DiffOrig command is also present.

                        between the current buffer and the file
                        it was loaded from. (see :help DiffOrig)
